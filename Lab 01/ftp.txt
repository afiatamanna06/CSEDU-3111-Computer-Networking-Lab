230-This service is managed by Information Services.  It holds information
 which may be useful to system managers and space is provided for
 individuals and groups upon request.  Upload facilities are also
 available.  Anyone can make use of this service. 
 
 The files called ls-lR and index are a list of all the files that are
 available from this server.  ls-lR.Z is a compressed version of this
 file.
 
 Files available on the archive are to be found in the 'pub' directory.
 
 Upload facilities for file sharing
 ----------------------------------
 
 The directory 'incoming' is a place where files may be stored.  This
 directory is provided as a resource for communicating files between
 University of Edinburgh users and others; it is not a free Internet
 resource.  If you put files here then please send mail to the FTP server
 maintainer (ftpmaster@ed.ac.uk) explaining what should be done with
 them.  If notification is not received, the files will be removed.  This
 directory is not readable so once files are placed here you will not be
 able to see them.  You should also contact the person who you are
 passing the files to and provide them with the server name and names of
 all the files e.g.:
 
 		ftp://ftp.ed.ac.uk/incoming/myfile.txt
 
 To retrieve files, the exact filename and path should be used e.g.:
 
 		ftp://ftp.ed.ac.uk/incoming/myfile.txt
 
 The directory 'edupload' may be used by anyone connected to the
 University network to upload files in the same manner as above. 
 However, no mail notification needs to be sent to the FTP server
 maintainer and files will remain in the directory for one week.  Please
 do NOT upload files to both this and the incoming directory - choose one
 or the other. 
 
 Anyone may download files from /incoming or /edupload if they know the
 name of the file that is stored there. 
 
 How to upload a file to the server
 ----------------------------------
         
 It is best to use a command line ftp program.  Windows, Mac and Linux
 systems all provide a command line ftp client.  Open a command or
 terminal window and then type:
 
         ftp ftp.ed.ac.uk
 
 Login using the username 'anonymous' and use your email address as password.
 
 Next change your current working directory to either the incoming
 directory or the edupload directory (be aware that edupload can only be
 accessed from the University network). 
 
         cd /incoming
 
 Next upload your file(s) using the put command:
 
         put myfile.txt
 
 Your file will then be loaded on the ftp server.  You will not be able
 to get a file listing of it though as the directory is protected.
